Key Visualizations Created:
  1. Sales and Profit by Region
  2. A Clustered Column Chart showing the performance of different regions in terms of revenue and profit.

Insight: The West had the highest sales but not the highest profit, highlighting a potential cost or discount issue.

Profit by Sub-Category: A Bar Chart analyzing which product sub-categories are profitable and which are not.

Insight: Sub-categories like Tables showed negative profit, even with decent sales â€” indicating a need for review.
Business Insights Highlighted: Some high-sales regions are underperforming in profit, possibly due to high operational costs.

Outcome: This Power BI report demonstrates how data can be used to uncover actionable insights and guide business decisions. It also highlights the importance of selecting the right chart types, keeping visuals clean, and always focusing on what the data is telling us.
